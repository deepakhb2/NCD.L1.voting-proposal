2. Make sure you've installed yarn: `npm install -g yarn`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Create a test near account [NEAR test account]
5. Install the NEAR CLI globally: [near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain

    yarn install --global near-cli

Step 2: Configure your NEAR CLI

Configure your near-cli to authorize your test account recently created:

    near login

Step 3: Build and make a smart contract development deploy  
--------------------------------

Build the NEAR library smart contract code and deploy the local development server: `yarn build:release` (see `package.json` for a full list of `scripts` you can run with `yarn`). This script return to you a provisional smart contract deployed (save it to use later). You can also follow the instructions on the folder *scripts*.
